# SIBSAPIMarket
.NET Core SDK that allows you to take advantage of the SIBS Market API (https://www.sibsapimarket.com/). Still under development!

This is still very early in development and I'm working on it as I can, my main focus right now is on the APIs to read information.
After those are done I will start handling payment's APIs.

I'm aiming for an SDK that allows others to easily tap into the SIBSAPIMarket with all it's security features, meaning I want to expose
those security requirements to be handled by the client as easily as possible and with as much variety as possible (Embedded or Redirect flows).
